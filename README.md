# GISTools

GIS tools for Swift, including a GeoJSON implementation and many algorithms ported from https://github.com/Turfjs/turf/tree/master/packages (https://turfjs.org)

## Notes

This package makes some assumptions about what is equal, i.e. coordinates that are inside of `1e-10` degrees are regarded as equal. See `GISTool.equalityDelta`.
