# GISTools

GIS tools for Swift, including a GeoJSON implementation and many algorithms ported from https://github.com/Turfjs/turf/tree/master/packages (https://turfjs.org)

## Notes

This package makes some assumptions about what is equal, i.e. coordinates that are inside of `1e-10` degrees are regarded as equal. See `GISTool.equalityDelta`.

## Installation with Swift Package Manager

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/Outdooractive/gis-tools", from: "0.3.4"),
],
targets: [
    .target(name: "MyTarget", dependencies: [
        .product(name: "GISTools", package: "gis-tools"),
    ]),
]
```

## Features

- Supports the full GeoJSON standard, with some exceptions (see `TODO.md`)
- Supports WKT/WKB
- GeoJSON encoder/decoder (also with Codable support)
- Spatial search with a RTree
- Supports EPSG:3857 (web mercator) and EPSG:4326 (geodetic)

## Usage

```swift
import GISTools

var feature = Feature(Point(Coordinate3D(latitude: 3.870163, longitude: 11.518585)))
feature.properties = [
    "test": 1,
    "test2": 5.567,
    "test3": [1, 2, 3],
    "test4": [
        "sub1": 1,
        "sub2": 2
    ]
]

// either:
let jsonString = feature.asJsonString(prettyPrinted: true)
let feature = Feature(jsonString: jsonString)

// or:
let jsonData = feature.asJsonData(prettyPrinted: true)
let feature = Feature(jsonData: jsonData)

// or:
let jsonData = try JSONEncoder().encode(feature)
let feature = try JSONDecoder().decode(Feature.self, from: jsonData)

// or:
let someGeoJson = GeoJsonReader.geoJsonFrom(json: [
    "type": "Point",
    "coordinates": [100.0, 0.0],
])
let someGeoJson = GeoJsonReader.geoJsonFrom(contentsOf: URL(...))
let someGeoJson = GeoJsonReader.geoJsonFrom(jsonData: Data(...))
let someGeoJson = GeoJsonReader.geoJsonFrom(jsonString: "{\"type\":\"Point\",\"coordinates\":[100.0,0.0]}")

// Wraps *any* GeoJSON into a FeatureCollection
let featureCollection = FeatureCollection(jsonData: someData)
let featureCollection = try JSONDecoder().decode(FeatureCollection.self, from: someData)

...
```
